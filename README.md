- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashay right now working as a Senior Software Engineer with Apisero Inc.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming an awesome web 3, blockchain developer. I truly beleive web 3 is about to bring a paradigm shift in how societies work and make it more -  fairer & opportunistic for everyone. It's a hope even for the most under powered, under represented individual to own a piece of this massive economic abundant world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity inorder to create powerful smart contracts & dApps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NFT, DeFi & DAO projects.
